## Project Description/Outline
We are going to tell a visual story using data from the Technology stocks on the New York Stock (NYSE), and the Over The Counter (OTC), London Stock Exchange (LSE) by creating a dashboard page to include three views of user-driven interaction visualizations. (ie. menus, dropdowns, textboxes). We will use Chartjs library to build user interfaces, to add to the visualization. For our project we will use Python-Flask - powered by RESTFUL API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a MongoDB database. We will choose three different stocks, Microsoft, Google and Apple and analyze each one. Our project will be powered by a data set with at least 100 records. Change from stock Open price to Closed Price. We will use filters for the various stock exchanges.
